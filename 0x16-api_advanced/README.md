**Project Duration:**  
- Start: Aug 13, 2024, 6:00 AM  
- End: Aug 14, 2024, 6:00 AM  

## Background Context
A recommended API for practice is the Reddit API, which offers numerous endpoints. Many of these endpoints do not require authentication, providing a rich dataset for practice. Familiarity with API calls will be beneficial not only in interviews but also for personal projects.

## Resources
You should familiarize yourself with the following resources:
- [Reddit API Documentation](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api)
- [Query String](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without external assistance:
- Reading API documentation to identify relevant endpoints.
- Using APIs with pagination.
- Parsing JSON data from API responses.
- Implementing recursive API calls.
- Sorting a dictionary by value.

## Requirements

### General
- **Editors Allowed:** `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- **Environment:** Your code will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.4.3.
- **File Requirements:**
  - All files should end with a new line.
  - The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
  - Imported libraries must be organized in alphabetical order.
  - A `README.md` file is mandatory at the root of the project folder.
  - Your code must follow PEP 8 style guidelines.
  - All files must be executable.
  - File lengths will be tested using `wc`.
  - All modules must include documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`).
- **HTTP Requests:** You must use the `requests` module for sending HTTP requests to the Reddit API.
